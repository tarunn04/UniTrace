UniTrace - College Bus Tracking Application

UniTrace is a Flutter application designed to track college buses in real-time. It consists of three sub-applications: one for students, one for drivers, and another one for the admin. The main goal of UniTrace is to provide a seamless experience for students, drivers, and administrators to ensure efficient bus tracking and management within the college campus.

Features

Student Application
The student application allows students to track the live location of the college bus streamed by the bus driver through the driver application. It offers the following features:

Live Bus Tracking: Students can view the real-time location of the college bus on a map.
Custom Alerts: Students can set custom alerts to receive notifications when the bus is approaching their location or a specific bus stop.
Call the Driver: Students can easily contact the bus driver using the built-in calling feature.
Chat Among Bus People: Students can communicate with other students on the bus through a chat system.
College Era System: Students can view important college announcements and updates.
Attendance Marking: Students can mark their attendance when boarding or leaving the bus. The marker color will change in real-time to indicate the bus status.
Driver Application
The driver application allows bus drivers to manage their route and interact with students. It offers the following features:

Live Location Streaming: Drivers can share their live location with the student application, enabling real-time bus tracking.
Stoppage Decision: Drivers can decide whether to stop at a particular bus stop or continue to the next one.
Communication with Students: Drivers can communicate with students through the built-in chat system.
Emergency Assistance: Drivers can receive alerts and assistance requests from students in case of emergencies.
Admin Application
The admin application is designed for administrators to manage the UniTrace system efficiently. It provides the following functionalities:

Database Management: Administrators can add and maintain student and driver records in the database.
Database Regulation: Administrators can ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database by regulating and updating student and driver information.
